# Spotify-Webpage-Imitation
Imitation of Spotify webpage layout using HTML, CSS, and Sass where I used Flex property on most cases and included a self-made kind of framework for margins and paddings. Also includes implementation of “cards” for song or playlist displays.

#### First personal project ever out of tutorial hell and decided to learn the basics of Git and Github.
Issues:
1. Not responsive.
2. There are repetitive properties that could be put in a class for general use.
3. There are some parts that were just forced and lacked(?) more organized CSS logic.
