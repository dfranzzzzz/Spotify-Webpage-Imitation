# Spotify-Webpage-Imitation
Imitation of Spotify webpage layout using HTML, CSS, Sass. Used flex properties on most and also icons are just from FontAwesome. 

#### First personal project ever out of tutorial hell and decided to learn the basics of Git and Github.
Issues:
1. Not responsive.
2. There are repetitive properties that could be put in a class for general use.
3. There are some parts that were just forced and lacked(?) more organized CSS logic.
